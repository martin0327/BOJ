### 문제 설명

<p>An alien has just landed on Earth, and really likes our music. Lucky for us.</p>

<p>The alien would like to bring home its favorite human songs, but it only has a very strange instrument to do it with: a piano with just 4 keys of different pitches.</p>

<p>The alien converts a song by writing it down as a series of keys on the alien piano. Obviously, this piano will not be able to convert our songs completely, as our songs tend to have many more than 4 pitches.</p>

<p>The alien will settle for converting our songs with the following rules instead:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The first note in our song can be converted to any key on the alien piano.</li>
	<li>For every note after,
	<ul>
		<li>if its pitch is higher than the previous note, it should be converted into a higher-pitched key than the previous note's conversion;</li>
		<li>if lower, it should be converted into a lower-pitched key than the previous note's conversion;</li>
		<li>if exactly identical, it should be converted into the same key as the previous note's conversion.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: two notes with the same pitch do not need to be converted into the same key if they are not adjacent.</p>

<p>What the alien wants to know is: how often will it have to break its rules when converting a particular song?</p>

<p>To elaborate, let us describe one of our songs as having <b>K </b>notes. The first note we describe as "note 1", the second note "note 2", and the last note "note <b>K</b>."</p>

<p>So note 2 comes immediately after note 1.</p>

<p>Now if note 2 is lower than note 1 in our version of the song, yet converted to an equally-pitched or lower-pitched key (relative to note 2's conversion) in the alien's version of the song, then we consider that a single rule break.</p>

<p>For each test case, return the minimum amount of times the alien must necessarily break one of its rules in converting that song.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <b>T</b>. <b>T</b> test cases follow.</p>

<p>Each test case consists of two lines.</p>

<p>The first line consists of a single integer, <b>K</b>.</p>

<p>The second line consists of <b>K</b> space-separated integers, <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>A<sub>2</sub></b> ... <b>A<sub>K</sub></b>, where <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> refers to the pitch of the i-th note for this test case.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line containing <code>Case #x: y</code>, where <code>x</code> is the test case number (starting from 1) and <code>y</code> is the minimum number of times that particular test case will require the alien to break its own rules during the conversion process.</p>
