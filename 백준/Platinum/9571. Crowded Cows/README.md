### 문제 설명

<p>Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 50,000) are grazing along a one-dimensional fence.  Cow i is standing at location x(i) and has height h(i) (1 <= x(i),h(i) <= 1,000,000,000).</p><p>A cow feels "crowded" if there is another cow at least twice her height within distance D on her left, and also another cow at least twice her height within distance D on her right (1 <= D <= 1,000,000,000).  Since crowded cows produce less milk, Farmer John would like to count the number of such cows.  Please help him.</p>

### 입력

### 출력 

 <ul><li>Line 1: The number of crowded cows.</li></ul>
